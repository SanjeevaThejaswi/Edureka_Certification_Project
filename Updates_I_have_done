I have added :

/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Edureka_Certification_Project/gradle/wrapper# cat gradle-wrapper.properties 
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.10-bin.zip
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists

I have uploaded Kubernetes continuous deploy.hpi plugin in order to execute functions in the jenkins file
<find the plugin in plugins folder>

In kubernetesDeploy function, for kubeConfigId ---> we need to go to K8s master, 
follow these steps:
  ls -al
  cd .kube
  cat config
copy text and 
go to jenkins -> Manage jenkins-> manage credentials -> add credentials
select kubernetes configuration from drop down
under kubeconfig paste the context which you copied fromm k8s master node.

I have done some modifications regarding ports in  yaml files
please find those updated files under <updated_files> folder



While running the job in jenkins, Before going to deploy in k8s, it will prompt for Yes or No,
In order to provide input, go to project dashboard and hover mouse on last step (which is in idle state), 
Deploy to Production?
Yes/No (click on Yes)
